Dear {{ name }},

You had several Mosquito Alert Entolab reports assigned, but they were not validated for more than {{ n_days }} days. Therefore,
they have been automatically removed from your queue so that they can be assigned to other experts for validation.

At any time, you can log in back to EntoLab and claim more reports to validate. However, please claim only the reports
you are going to process immediately as otherwise there is a risk that they get indefinitely blocked by a given expert.
If this happens the user will not get feedback for a long time, which is harmful for motivation.

Thank you very much for your understanding. Your valued contribution to the system is always highly appreciated!

The Mosquito Alert Team.
