<h2>Collaborators</h2> <p>Mosquito Alert is made possible also thanks to the participation of a number of experts

    the field of public health, invasive species control, and environmental education.</p> <h2>Financing and

    communication dissemination (including the Spanish <em>Plan Estal</em>, the EU’s Horizon 2020 funding line, and “la
