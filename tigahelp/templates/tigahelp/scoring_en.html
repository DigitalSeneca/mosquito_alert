        <h2>SCORE INFO</h2>
        <p>Actions taken in Mosquito Alert have recognition and rewards in the form of points. The number of points per
            report varies depending on the information provided and its quality.</p>
        <p>The maximum points that can be obtained per report are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invasive <em>Aedes</em> Mosquito: 20 points</li>
            <li>Common mosquito: 14 points</li>
            <li>Storm drain breeding site: 20 points</li>
            <li>Other breeding site in a public area: 16 points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, there are extra bonuses for the first mosquito of the season, the first report of the day or for
            participating frequently. When you reach a specific number of reports, you not only get extra points, but
            you get a special trophy. There are different trophies according to the milestones reached.</p>
        <p>Those reports that are sent as a mosquito but turn out not to be mosquitoes, according to expert validation,
            will not earn points. A photo that does not allow experts to identify the mosquito or breeding place will
            not be scored either.</p>
        <p>The accumulation of points will allow you to go up a <b>level</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(1) Novice (beginner)</li>
            <li>(2) Contributor (contributor)</li>
            <li>(3) Expert (expert)</li>
            <li>(4) Master (master)</li>
            <li>(5) Grandmaster (grandmaster)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These icons indicate the level reached:</p>
